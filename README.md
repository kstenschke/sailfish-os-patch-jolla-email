# sailfish-os-patch-jolla-email

Patch for Sailfish OS Jolla-Email App:

Improves readability of plaintext- and HTML-email views on display of phones and in light surroundings.

This patch removes the white background and displays text of emails white on the blurred background of the active Ambience.
The HTML view is additionally being adjusted to override unnecessary custom styles and display the email in sans-serif letters without too many custom/decorative styles (borders, shadows, etc.).
