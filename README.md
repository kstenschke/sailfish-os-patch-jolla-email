# sailfish-os-patch-jolla-email-readability

Patch for Sailfish OS Jolla-Email App:

Better readability of plaintext- and HTML-emails on display of phones and in light surroundings.

This patch removes the white background and displays text of emails white on the blurred background of the active Ambience.
The HTML view is additionally being adjusted to override unnecessary custom styles and display the email in sans-serif letters without too many custom/decorative styles (borders, shadows, etc.).
