# sailfish-os-patch-jolla-email-readability

Patch for Sailfish OS Jolla-Email App:

Improves readability of emails on display of phones and in light surroundings.

This patch removes the white background and displays text of plain-text emails white on the blurred background of the active Ambience.
The HTML view is additionally being adjusted to override unnecessary custom styles, and to use sans-serif letters, custom/decorative styles (borders, shadows, etc.) are being overriden to not be used.
